"""
work_section.py — the "Работа" slot in the daily guide (Professional role).

Read-only: this module imports nothing that writes, and never touches the
files it lists — a person edits their own work products in their own
workspace, not through the guide. No LLM: a work item's title/link/context
is a fact from a file or it is honestly absent; there is no generative
fallback here (the hard-fail policy's "no invented facts" applies just as
much to structural data as to card content).

Two levels, matching FORMAT.md's own type axis:
  generic — any base with 2.2-typed entries in type-index.json. Title + link
    only; no status, no ranking (guide-kit has no portable-across-tools
    notion of "active").
  iwe — this specific template's convention: today's DayPlan table (peer
    session 2026-07-16/17, turn 11 — an earlier bottleneck/priority design
    was scrapped: docs/WP-REGISTRY.md's "P" column is a long-lived project
    ID, not urgency, so ranking by it would have grouped by domain instead
    of picking "today"). DayPlan is already a curated, already-ordered "what
    matters today" list — this module reads it as-is, no re-ranking, no cap.

`work_section: off` is the default everywhere (config off-by-default,
peer session escalation 5) — enabling `iwe` for a real installation is a
pilot-only decision made live in chat, not a self-touchable file marker.
