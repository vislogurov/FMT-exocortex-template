# WP-5 Ubuntu-portability audit (2026-07-22, факт #5): 132 scripts, no shared
# library — IWE workspace root was resolved 5 different ways (IWE_WORKSPACE/
# IWE_ROOT/IWE_ROOT_ARG env vars, in varying precedence), governance-repo
# default duplicated with 4 variable names, and Telegram notification existed
# in 3 incompatible conventions (jq-built JSON vs hand-escaped, TG_TOKEN vs
# TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN directly) — some alert paths silently dropped messages
# because a caller used a convention no other caller tested. Pilot migration
# (this file) covers day-open-pipeline.sh + day-open-preflight.sh; the other
# ~40 call sites are backlog (WP-5 П4), not blind-swept in one pass.

# iwe_scheduler_active — is any IWE role scheduler (strategist/synchronizer/

# Returns 0 (active) / 1 (not active).
#
# WP-5 Ubuntu-audit факт #4: day-open-scaffold.sh checked `launchctl list`
# unconditionally — on Linux launchctl doesn't exist, so the check silently
# saw empty output and reported the scheduler as down (🔴) every single day
# even when the equivalent systemd --user timer was running fine. Two
# independent call sites had ALSO drifted from each other on macOS (one used
# the current per-role launchd labels post-issue-#261, the other still used
# the pre-#261 legacy iwe.scheduler/iwe.feedback labels that don't match any
# plist actually shipped) — this is now the single source of truth for both.
#
# issue #314 (third recurrence of the same class after #261/#292): the
# template ships no launcher-detection branch for cron, so a WSL install
# where the pilot hand-rolls a crontab entry (no launchd, no systemd --user
# timers there) always fell through to `return 1` → daily false Mode A +
# auto-incident even though the scheduler ran fine. Two independent signals
# added: (1) crontab, the launcher WSL installs actually use; (2) a generic
# evidence fallback — a scheduler log written in the last 2 days under
# ~/logs/synchronizer/, regardless of which launcher wrote it — so the next
# unenumerated launch mechanism doesn't reopen this same bug class again.

# iwe_safe_pull [-C REPO] — git pull --rebase that refuses to silently DROP a
# local commit whose patch is already upstream under a different hash (the
# case a plain `git rebase` mishandles: same change, different SHA, dropped
# without warning). Returns non-zero instead of exiting the calling script —
# callers keep their own `|| abort "..."` / cleanup-trap flow.
#
# Folded in from the formerly-standalone scripts/safe-pull.sh (found with
# zero callers in the same audit, факт #5) rather than deleted: this exact
# failure mode is a live, open risk this pilot's own sessions hit twice on
# 2026-07-23 (see feedback_parallel_agents_shared_workdir_git_race.md), and
# several callers were still doing a naive `git pull --rebase`.
#
# Scope: fast-forward and "only local ahead" cases are handled fully. A true
# two-sided divergence with NO same-patch collision rebases automatically
# (no tty/confirmation gate — day-open-pipeline.sh runs unattended from two
# machines by design, and gating on tty would turn every ordinary divergence
# into a hard pipeline failure; the git-cherry pre-check above IS the safety
# gate, not a human glancing at the output). A collision (the actual unsafe
# case) always returns 2 without touching the branch, tty or not.
