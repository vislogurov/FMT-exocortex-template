# IWE_ROOT/IWE_ROOT_ARG env vars, in varying precedence), governance-repo
# default duplicated with 4 variable names, and Telegram notification existed

# because a caller used a convention no other caller tested. Pilot migration
# (this file) covers day-open-pipeline.sh + day-open-preflight.sh; the other

# Returns 0 (active) / 1 (not active).
#
# WP-5 Ubuntu-audit факт #4: day-open-scaffold.sh checked `launchctl list`
# unconditionally — on Linux launchctl doesn't exist, so the check silently
# saw empty output and reported the scheduler as down (🔴) every single day
# even when the equivalent systemd --user timer was running fine. Two
# independent call sites had ALSO drifted from each other on macOS (one used
# the current per-role launchd labels post-issue-#261, the other still used
# the pre-#261 legacy iwe.scheduler/iwe.feedback labels that don't match any
# plist actually shipped) — this is now the single source of truth for both.
#
# issue #314 (third recurrence of the same class after #261/#292): the
# template ships no launcher-detection branch for cron, so a WSL install
# where the pilot hand-rolls a crontab entry (no launchd, no systemd --user
# timers there) always fell through to `return 1` → daily false Mode A +
# auto-incident even though the scheduler ran fine. Two independent signals
# added: (1) crontab, the launcher WSL installs actually use; (2) a generic
# evidence fallback — a scheduler log written in the last 2 days under
# ~/logs/synchronizer/, regardless of which launcher wrote it — so the next
# unenumerated launch mechanism doesn't reopen this same bug class again.
#
# issue #347 (fourth recurrence, this time not in detection but in interpretation):
# a plain boolean collapsed three very different situations into "not active" —
# never installed here, installed but stopped, and "the launcher query itself
# failed so nothing can be concluded". Callers painted all three red and opened a
# fresh incident file every morning on an install where the scheduler had simply
# never been deployed. iwe_scheduler_state() below reports which of the four it is;
# iwe_scheduler_active() stays as the boolean wrapper for callers that only ask
# "is it running right now".

# callers keep their own `|| abort "..."` / cleanup-trap flow.
#
# Folded in from the formerly-standalone scripts/safe-pull.sh (found with

# two-sided divergence with NO same-patch collision rebases automatically
# (no tty/confirmation gate — day-open-pipeline.sh runs unattended from two

# into a hard pipeline failure; the git-cherry pre-check above IS the safety
# gate, not a human glancing at the output). A collision (the actual unsafe
