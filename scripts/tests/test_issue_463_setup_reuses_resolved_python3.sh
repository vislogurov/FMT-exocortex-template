# test_issue_463_setup_reuses_resolved_python3.sh — WP-529 F6 (Evgenii Red
# Team review 2026-08-19, defect #2). Renamed from
# test_setup_reuses_resolved_python3.sh (WP-529 Red Team round 2, 19.08) to
# match run-issue-tests.sh's test_issue_*.sh glob — the original name never
# ran in CI at all.
#
# setup.sh used to run scripts/lib/find-python3.sh only for its exit code
# (stdout discarded to /dev/null) and then call bare `python3` again to
# generate executor-catalog.yaml. On a real Apple Silicon machine those can
# be two DIFFERENT interpreters: the resolver walks a fixed candidate list
# (python3, /opt/homebrew/bin/python3, /usr/local/bin/python3, /usr/bin/…)
# and returns the first one with yaml importable, while bare `python3` just
# follows PATH — if PATH's `python3` has no yaml but a later resolver
# candidate does, setup.sh finds a working interpreter and then throws it
# away before actually using it.
#
# This test does not need two real Apple-Silicon python installs: it makes
# find-python3.sh's FIRST candidate (`python3` on PATH) resolve to a stub
# with no yaml, forcing the resolver to walk to its second candidate — a
# second stub that delegates to this machine's real yaml-capable python3.
# A setup.sh that discards the resolved path and calls bare `python3` again
# will hit the no-yaml stub and fail; a setup.sh that reuses the resolved
# path succeeds. Requires the host running this test to have a working
# python3+PyYAML somewhere findable via `command -v` (true for CI and any
# dev machine that can run the rest of this repo's test suite).

# Evgenii Red Team review 2026-08-19 (defect #2 continued): three iterations
# to get this check right, found by actually running each against both the
# fixed setup.sh AND the exact pre-F6 defective setup.sh (commit 6dbbf19^):
#   1. Grepping $OUT for "ModuleNotFoundError" was never the actual contract
#      — old setup.sh caught the resolver's own defect and turned the
#      traceback into a friendly warning with exit 0, so the substring never
#      reached $OUT on EITHER old or fixed code.
#   2. A presence-only probe check (`grep -q "no-yaml-stub-invoked"`) is also
#      wrong: the snippet's own internal `find-python3.sh` call (setup.sh
#      line ~700) legitimately walks PATH's stub as its rejected first
#      candidate — that write happens on a CORRECT setup.sh too.
#   3. A count-based check (`invocations <= 1`) is ALSO wrong, and only
#      surfaces on the actual pre-F6 code: that code never calls
#      find-python3.sh in this section at all, so its single illegitimate
#      bare-`python3` call for the generator is numerically indistinguishable
#      from a correct setup.sh's single legitimate resolver probe — both are
#      exactly 1 invocation.
# The only signal that is unambiguous on both old and new code: WHAT was the
# stub invoked WITH. The resolver only ever probes candidates via
# `"$resolved" -c "import yaml"` (find-python3.sh above) — it never receives
# generate-executor-catalog.py as an argument. So checking for that filename
# in the probe log (which now records the stub's own $* on each call)
# distinguishes "the resolver rejected this candidate" from "something ran
# the generator itself on the rejected interpreter" — exactly the check
# Evgenii asked for ("отклонённый Python не запускал
# generate-executor-catalog.py").
#
# Cold review 2026-08-19 (Medium): this couples the signal to
# find-python3.sh's own contract — its header documents the probe as the
# literal `-c "import yaml"`, never a filename, so a future change to THAT
# file (not owned by this test) that started passing a script path to its
# internal probe would defeat this check. Left as documented coupling rather
# than re-architected: the resolver's contract already forbids that shape of
# call, and building extra machinery here to guard against a hypothetical
# breaking change to a different file's documented contract is the kind of
# defensive complexity this repo's own style guide (P5) warns against.
